# Integrated D&D Game Manager

## Goal:
Provide basic web-based player and campaign management for Dungeons and Dragons 5e games. All users should be able to participate with a smartphone, tablet, or PC; either in person or remotely (with dialogue via Zoom, Skype, chat app support). Fill a gap between apps that handle one part of the game (character or campaign creation) but are not integrated ('Fight Club', 'Game Master'), and apps that are graphics-heavy and cumbersome ('D&D Beyond') 

## Target:
Current pen-and-paper players. Demographics, according to the publisher of the guidebooks (Wizards of the Coast), are 40/60% female/male, 75% between ages 20 and 39.

## Data:
( https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/ ) This data is available as part of the 'System Reference Document 5.1 (“SRD5”)' granted through use of the Open Gaming License, Version 1.0a.

This includes the basic rule set for D&D 5e games (player races, classes, monsters, combat mechanics, etc.). It should be sufficient for full character creation and equipping, tracking stats (XP, level, etc.), and building campaigns.

## Database Schema:
(players table will have a lot of columns)  
![Database Schema](/schema.png)

## Potential issues with API:
none foreseen

## Sensitive information to secure:
passwords

## Functionality:
App should assist users in (player) character creation by preselecting options based on choices made during the process (i.e. wizards choose wizard spells, bards choose instrument proficiencies, etc.). App should collect players into a single campaign, run by a single user (the 'dungeon master' or 'DM'). DMs should get access to player updates (adding XP, subtracting damage from HP, etc.). Players should get access to all of their own data, plus select data from other players in the campaign (name, race, class, gender).

## User Flow:

## Possible Non-CRUD Features:
- Ability score checks, saving throws, attacks (dice rolls) by player or DM in-browser
- Live updating of player interface with DM actions (damage totals, status changes, etc.) pushed from server
- Live updating of DM interface with player actions (equipment changes, item usage, etc.) pushed from server
- Data export to documents (character sheets)
- Dungeon maps created by DM, with visible sections revealed to players in-browser
- Autogenerated NPC and monster objects sent to players, bypassing database, for on-the-fly content
